/**
 * Tests for EventBus race conditions
 *
 * These tests expose the race condition in send.ts:34-42 where concurrent
 * emit() calls can cause events to be skipped or processed out of order.
 *
 * This is the RED phase of TDD - these tests are expected to fail or be flaky.
 *
 * KNOWN ISSUES EXPOSED:
 * 1. send() returns before event is processed when processing=true
 * 2. Events can be skipped when concurrent emit() calls overlap
 * 3. Cascaded events ($.send inside handlers) don't await properly
 * 4. Global EventBus can get stuck with processing=true
