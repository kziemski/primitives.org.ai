{"id":"aip-4d5","title":"ARCH: Audit and document global state usage","description":"getContext(), getProvider(), getModel() use global state. Document all globals, assess concurrent safety, plan migration to AsyncLocalStorage.","notes":"# Global State Audit - Complete Findings\n\n## Executive Summary\nIdentified **47+ instances** of global/module-level mutable state across 16 packages. The codebase uses a mix of patterns: singletons, module-level variables, and AsyncLocalStorage fallbacks. Most are intentional design choices for performance, but several pose concurrency risks.\n\n---\n\n## Category 1: HIGH RISK - Context State (Concurrent Request Isolation)\n\n### ai-functions/src/context.ts (Lines 77, 115-121)\n```typescript\nlet globalContext: ExecutionContext = {}\nlet asyncLocalStorage: { ... } | null = null\nlet asyncLocalStorageInitialized = false\n```\n**Risk**: Without AsyncLocalStorage (browser/edge), `withContext()` falls back to mutating global state, causing race conditions in concurrent requests.\n**Mitigation**: Already attempts AsyncLocalStorage; fallback is unavoidable for browser environments.\n\n### ai-core/src/context.ts (Lines 43, 78-84)\n```typescript\nlet globalContext: ExecutionContext = {}\nlet asyncLocalStorage: { ... } | null = null\nlet asyncLocalStorageInitialized = false\n```\n**Risk**: Duplicate context module - same issues as ai-functions. Potential for divergence.\n**Recommendation**: Consider consolidating to single context module or re-exporting.\n\n---\n\n## Category 2: HIGH RISK - Recording/Batch State\n\n### ai-functions/src/batch-map.ts (Lines 441-453)\n```typescript\nlet currentRecordingItem: unknown = null\nlet currentItemPlaceholder: string = ''\nlet capturedOperations: CapturedOperation[] = []\nlet isRecording = false\nlet operationCounter = 0\n```\n**Risk**: Recording state is global - if two batch operations run concurrently, they will corrupt each other's state.\n**Recommendation**: Migrate to AsyncLocalStorage-based recording context or use explicit context passing.\n\n### ai-functions/src/ai-promise.ts (Lines 121, 127)\n```typescript\nlet currentRecording: MapRecording | null = null\nlet resolutionScheduled = false\n```\n**Risk**: Same pattern - recording state vulnerable to concurrent corruption.\n\n---\n\n## Category 3: MEDIUM RISK - Singleton Registries\n\n### ai-providers/src/registry.ts (Lines 122, 343-344)\n```typescript\nlet llmFetchInstance: typeof fetch | null = null\nlet defaultRegistry: ProviderRegistryProvider | null = null\nlet defaultRegistryPromise: Promise\u003cProviderRegistryProvider\u003e | null = null\n```\n**Risk**: Singletons are initialized lazily with promise caching - generally safe but prevents per-request provider configuration.\n**Pattern**: Promise deduplication pattern is correct.\n\n### ai-providers/src/llm.do.ts (Line 474)\n```typescript\nlet defaultLLM: LLM | null = null\n```\n**Risk**: WebSocket connection singleton - appropriate for connection pooling. Stateful (reconnect counters, pending requests).\n**Assessment**: Intentional design for persistent connections.\n\n### ai-database/src/schema/provider.ts (Lines 233-234)\n```typescript\nlet globalProvider: DBProvider | null = null\nlet providerPromise: Promise\u003cDBProvider\u003e | null = null\n```\n**Risk**: Database provider singleton - appropriate for connection pooling. Uses promise deduplication.\n**Assessment**: Correct singleton pattern with `setProvider()` escape hatch.\n\n---\n\n## Category 4: MEDIUM RISK - Mutable Configuration\n\n### ai-props/src/generate.ts (Line 30)\n```typescript\nlet globalConfig: AIPropsConfig = { ...DEFAULT_CONFIG }\n```\n**Risk**: Global config mutation affects all callers. No isolation between requests.\n**Recommendation**: Consider context-based config or per-call overrides.\n\n### ai-functions/src/budget.ts (Line 678)\n```typescript\nlet currentBudgetTracker: BudgetTracker | null = null\n```\n**Risk**: Budget tracking is global - cannot track budgets per-request without AsyncLocalStorage.\n**Note**: Uses nested tracker propagation which partially mitigates.\n\n---\n\n## Category 5: LOW RISK - Caches and Counters\n\n### language-models/src/models.ts (Line 43)\n```typescript\nlet modelsCache: ModelInfo[] | null = null\n```\n**Risk**: Low - immutable cache, loaded once.\n\n### ai-workflows/src/timer-registry.ts (Lines 19, 24, 133)\n```typescript\nconst activeTimers: Map\u003cstring, TimerEntry\u003e = new Map()\nlet timerCounter = 0\nlet cleanupRegistered = false\n```\n**Risk**: Intentional global registry for timer lifecycle management.\n**Note**: Registers global functions on `globalThis` (lines 117-130).\n\n### ai-database/src/execution-queue.ts (Line 591)\n```typescript\nlet defaultQueue: ExecutionQueue | null = null\n```\n**Risk**: Low - singleton queue with setter for testing.\n\n### human-in-the-loop/src/webhooks.ts (Line 608)\n```typescript\nlet defaultRegistry: WebhookRegistry | null = null\n```\n**Risk**: Low - singleton with getter pattern.\n\n### digital-workers/src/error-escalation.ts (Line 342)\n```typescript\nlet errorIdCounter = 0\n```\n**Risk**: Low - monotonic counter for unique IDs.\n\n---\n\n## Category 6: LOW RISK - Batch Provider Credentials\n\n### ai-functions/src/batch/bedrock.ts (Lines 87-96, 239)\n```typescript\nlet awsRegion: string | undefined\nlet awsAccessKeyId: string | undefined\n// ... more credentials\nlet jobCounter = 0\n```\n\n### ai-functions/src/batch/anthropic.ts (Lines 93-94)\n```typescript\nlet anthropicApiKey: string | undefined\nlet anthropicBaseUrl = 'https://api.anthropic.com/v1'\n```\n\n### ai-functions/src/batch/openai.ts (Lines 101-102)\n```typescript\nlet openaiApiKey: string | undefined\nlet openaiBaseUrl = 'https://api.openai.com/v1'\n```\n\n### ai-functions/src/batch/google.ts (Lines 58-63, 122)\n```typescript\nlet googleApiKey: string | undefined\n// ... more config\nlet jobCounter = 0\n```\n\n### ai-functions/src/batch/cloudflare.ts (Lines 77-80, 158)\n```typescript\nlet accountId: string | undefined\n// ... more config\nlet jobCounter = 0\n```\n\n### ai-functions/src/batch/memory.ts (Lines 40, 54)\n```typescript\nlet batchCounter = 0\nconst batches = new Map\u003cstring, MemoryBatch\u003e()\nlet memoryOptions: MemoryAdapterOptions = {}\n```\n**Risk**: Credentials and counters are module-level. Safe for single-tenant but problematic for multi-tenant.\n\n---\n\n## Category 7: globalThis Registration\n\n### ai-workflows/src/timer-registry.ts (Lines 114-130)\n```typescript\nregisterGlobalFunctions(globalThis)\n// Registers: globalThis.getActiveWorkflowTimerCount\n// Registers: globalThis.clearAllWorkflowTimers\n```\n**Purpose**: Debugging/testing convenience functions.\n**Risk**: Pollutes global namespace. Consider removing in production builds.\n\n### ai-providers/src/llm.do.test.ts (Lines 106, 112, 116)\n```typescript\nglobalThis.WebSocket = MockWebSocket  // Test mocking\n```\n**Assessment**: Test-only, appropriate usage.\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### Immediate Actions\n1. **Consolidate context modules** - ai-core and ai-functions have duplicate implementations\n2. **Add AsyncLocalStorage to batch-map.ts** - Recording state is highest risk for concurrent corruption\n\n### Medium-term Improvements\n1. **Context-aware batch providers** - Pass credentials via context rather than module globals\n2. **Consider request-scoped registries** - For multi-tenant scenarios\n\n### Architectural Considerations\n1. **AsyncLocalStorage is the right pattern** - Already used in context.ts, should be extended to other recording state\n2. **Singleton registries are appropriate** - For connection pooling (DB, WebSocket, providers)\n3. **Global functions on globalThis** - Consider feature flag for debug-only registration\n\n---\n\n## Files Audited\n- packages/ai-functions/src/context.ts\n- packages/ai-functions/src/batch-map.ts\n- packages/ai-functions/src/ai-promise.ts\n- packages/ai-functions/src/ai.ts\n- packages/ai-functions/src/budget.ts\n- packages/ai-functions/src/batch/*.ts\n- packages/ai-core/src/context.ts\n- packages/ai-database/src/schema/provider.ts\n- packages/ai-database/src/execution-queue.ts\n- packages/ai-database/src/ai-promise-db.ts\n- packages/ai-providers/src/registry.ts\n- packages/ai-providers/src/llm.do.ts\n- packages/ai-props/src/generate.ts\n- packages/ai-workflows/src/timer-registry.ts\n- packages/human-in-the-loop/src/webhooks.ts\n- packages/digital-workers/src/error-escalation.ts\n- packages/language-models/src/models.ts","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-12T04:12:17.064871-06:00","created_by":"nathanclevenger","updated_at":"2026-01-14T04:58:30.590986-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-12T05:07:52.229021-06:00","close_reason":"Global state audit completed.

Create `src/state-machine.ts` with:\n   - `stateMachine()` factory returning `StateMachineDefinition`\n   - `state()` helper for state configuration\n   - `transition()` helper for transition configuration\n   - `StateMachineInstance` with `.send()`, `.can()`, `.state`, `.context`\n\n2.

Leverage existing DependencyGraph for transition validation\n2. Use CascadeContext for tracing state transitions\n3. Integrate with WorkflowHistoryEntry for transition logging\n\n**Phase 3 - Advanced Features:**\n1. Hierarchical states (nested state machines)\n2. Parallel states (concurrent regions)\n3.

Create ai-errors package with base classes.","notes":"## Error Handling Pattern Analysis\n\n### Current State by Package\n\n#### 1. ai-functions (Most Comprehensive)\n**Pattern: ErrorCategory Enum + Typed Error Classes**\n- `ErrorCategory` enum: Network, RateLimit, InvalidInput, Authentication, Server, ContextLength, Unknown\n- Error classes:\n  - `RetryableError` - base with `retryable = true`, `category: ErrorCategory`\n  - `NonRetryableError` - base with `retryable = false`\n  - `NetworkError extends RetryableError`\n  - `RateLimitError extends RetryableError` (with `retryAfter?: number`)\n  - `CircuitOpenError` - `retryable = false`\n  - `BudgetExceededError` - with `type`, `limit`, `current`, `requested`\n- `classifyError(error: unknown): ErrorCategory` function for heuristic classification\n\n#### 2. digital-workers (Different Categorization)\n**Pattern: String Union Types + Severity Levels**\n- `ErrorCategory = 'transient' | 'permanent' | 'escalatable'` (different from ai-functions!)\n- `ErrorSeverity = 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical'`\n- `getErrorCategory(error: Error): ErrorCategory` - different implementation\n- `ClassifiedError` interface with rich metadata:\n  - id, original, severity, category, tier, agentId, taskId, timestamp, stack, previousError, context\n- `createClassifiedError()`, `classifyError()`, `isEscalatable()` utilities\n\n#### 3. ai-workflows\n**Pattern: Domain-Specific Error Classes**\n- `CircularDependencyError` - with `cyclePath: string[]` (duplicated from ai-database!)\n- `MissingDependencyError` - with `dependency`, `node` properties (duplicated!)\n- `CascadeTimeoutError` - with `timeout`, `elapsed`\n- `TierSkippedError` - with `tier`, `reason`\n- `AllTiersFailedError` - with `history: TierResult[]`\n- `CycleDetectedError` - with `cyclePath` (in topological-sort.ts)\n- `MissingNodeError` - with `missingNode`, `referencedBy`\n\n#### 4. ai-database\n**Pattern: Domain-Specific Errors Without Base Class**\n- `ValidationError` - with `field`, `value` properties\n- `SchemaValidationError` - with `code`, `path`, `details`\n- `CircularDependencyError` - duplicated from ai-workflows\n- `ContextOverflowError` - simple extension with just name\n\n#### 5. human-in-the-loop\n**Pattern: Domain-Specific + Duplicates**\n- `RetryError` - with `attempts`, `lastError` (different from ai-functions!)\n- `CircuitOpenError` - duplicated from ai-functions with different message!\n- `SLAViolationError` - with `requestId`, `deadline`\n\n#### 6. ai-core\n**Pattern: Minimal**\n- `NotImplementedError` - with `functionName`, `details`\n\n### Key Inconsistencies\n\n1. **Duplicate Error Classes**:\n   - `CircularDependencyError` exists in both ai-workflows AND ai-database\n   - `CircuitOpenError` exists in both ai-functions AND human-in-the-loop\n   - `MissingDependencyError` vs `MissingNodeError` - same concept, different names\n\n2. **Conflicting ErrorCategory Types**:\n   - ai-functions: enum with values like 'network', 'rate_limit', 'server'\n   - digital-workers: union type with 'transient', 'permanent', 'escalatable'\n   - These don't map cleanly to each other!\n\n3. **No Common Base Error Class**:\n   - Each package defines its own error classes extending Error directly\n   - No shared properties like error codes, timestamps, or tracing IDs\n\n4. **Inconsistent Retry/Category Properties**:\n   - ai-functions: `retryable: boolean` property on error\n   - digital-workers: derives retryability from category string\n   - human-in-the-loop: no retryability flag\n\n5. **Classification Logic Fragmented**:\n   - `classifyError()` in ai-functions uses message heuristics\n   - `getErrorCategory()` in digital-workers uses name patterns\n   - Different results for same errors!\n\n### Recommended Unified Strategy\n\n#### Create `ai-errors` Package\n\n```typescript\n// Base error with common properties\nexport abstract class PrimitivesError extends Error {\n  readonly code: string\n  readonly timestamp: Date\n  readonly traceId?: string\n  \n  abstract readonly category: ErrorCategory\n  abstract readonly retryable: boolean\n}\n\n// Unified categories\nexport type ErrorCategory = \n  | 'transient'    // Network, rate limit, server - can retry\n  | 'permanent'    // Validation, auth, config - cannot retry\n  | 'escalatable'  // Needs human intervention\n\n// Unified severity for escalation\nexport type ErrorSeverity = 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical'\n\n// Domain errors extend PrimitivesError\nexport class NetworkError extends PrimitivesError { category = 'transient'; retryable = true }\nexport class ValidationError extends PrimitivesError { category = 'permanent'; retryable = false }\nexport class EscalationError extends PrimitivesError { category = 'escalatable'; retryable = false }\n\n// Single classification function\nexport function classifyError(error: unknown): ClassifiedError\n```\n\n#### Migration Path\n1.

This design document outlines a durability layer that integrates with existing ai-database patterns.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### 1. Existing Durability Patterns in ai-database\n\n**DurablePromise (`durable-promise.ts`)**\n- Promise-like wrapper around database Actions\n- Persists state as Actions in a provider\n- Supports crash recovery, observability, time-agnostic execution\n- Priority tiers: priority, standard, flex, batch\n- Dependency tracking between operations\n- Context stack for inheriting execution settings\n\n**Key DurablePromise Features:**\n- `actionId` - Unique identifier for tracking\n- Status tracking: pending -\u003e active -\u003e completed/failed\n- Automatic retry support\n- Dependency waiting with polling\n- Batch scheduling integration\n\n**MemoryProvider (`memory-provider.ts`)**\n- In-memory reference implementation\n- Event sourcing with immutable Events\n- Actions for pending/active work\n- Artifacts for cached content\n- Relationships between entities\n- Concurrency control via Semaphore\n\n**ClickHouseDurableProvider (`durable-clickhouse.ts`)**\n- Production persistence using ClickHouse\n- Auto-recovery on startup\n- Batch operation support\n- Priority-based execution queues\n\n### 2. Current ai-workflows Architecture\n\n**WorkflowState (`types.ts`)**\n```typescript\ninterface WorkflowState {\n  current?: string           // State machine current state\n  context: Record\u003cstring, unknown\u003e  // User data\n  history: WorkflowHistoryEntry[]   // Execution log\n}\n```\n\n**WorkflowHistoryEntry**\n```typescript\ninterface WorkflowHistoryEntry {\n  timestamp: number\n  type: 'event' | 'schedule' | 'transition' | 'action'\n  name: string\n  data?: unknown\n}\n```\n\n**Key Components:**\n- Event handlers: `$.on.Noun.event(handler)`\n- Schedule handlers: `$.every.interval(handler)`\n- State management: `$.state`, `$.set()`, `$.get()`\n- Action semantics: `$.send()` (fire-and-forget), `$.do()` (durable), `$.try()` (non-durable)\n\n### 3. DatabaseContext Integration\n\nAlready defined but minimally implemented:\n```typescript\ninterface DatabaseContext {\n  recordEvent(event: string, data: unknown): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e\n  createAction(action: ActionData): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e\n  completeAction(id: string, result: unknown): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e\n  storeArtifact(artifact: ArtifactData): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e\n  getArtifact(key: string): Promise\u003cunknown | null\u003e\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Design Requirements\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n1. **Workflow State Persistence**\n   - Persist `WorkflowState` (context + history) to durable storage\n   - Support snapshot and event-sourcing hybrid approach\n\n2. **Handler Execution Durability**\n   - Track handler invocations as Actions\n   - Support at-least-once semantics with idempotency keys\n   - Enable retry on failure with exponential backoff\n\n3. **Event Replay**\n   - Replay events from a specific point in time\n   - Resume interrupted workflows after restart\n\n4. **Schedule Persistence**\n   - Persist scheduled jobs with next execution time\n   - Survive restarts without missing schedules\n\n5. **State Machine Persistence**\n   - Persist current state and transitions\n   - Enable visualization of state history\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements\n\n1. **Performance**: \u003c10ms overhead per operation\n2. **Reliability**: Zero data loss on crash\n3. **Observability**: Full audit trail of all operations\n4. **Scalability**: Support for distributed workers\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Design\n\n### Layer 1: DurableWorkflowProvider\n\n```typescript\ninterface DurableWorkflowProvider {\n  // Workflow instance management\n  createWorkflow(id: string, definition: WorkflowDefinition): Promise\u003cWorkflowInstance\u003e\n  getWorkflow(id: string): Promise\u003cWorkflowInstance | null\u003e\n  listWorkflows(filter?: WorkflowFilter): Promise\u003cWorkflowInstance[]\u003e\n  \n  // State persistence\n  saveState(workflowId: string, state: WorkflowState): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e\n  loadState(workflowId: string): Promise\u003cWorkflowState | null\u003e\n  \n  // Event handling\n  recordEvent(workflowId: string, event: WorkflowEvent): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e\n  replayEvents(workflowId: string, from?: Date): AsyncIterable\u003cWorkflowEvent\u003e\n  \n  // Action tracking (integrates with existing Actions system)\n  createAction(workflowId: string, action: DurableAction): Promise\u003cstring\u003e\n  updateAction(actionId: string, update: ActionUpdate): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e\n  getAction(actionId: string): Promise\u003cDurableAction | null\u003e\n}\n```\n\n### Layer 2: DurableWorkflowContext\n\nExtends WorkflowContext with durability:\n\n```typescript\ninterface DurableWorkflowContext extends WorkflowContext {\n  // Enhanced $.do with automatic durability\n  do\u003cTResult, TInput\u003e(\n    event: string, \n    data: TInput,\n    options?: DurableOptions\n  ): DurablePromise\u003cTResult\u003e\n  \n  // Checkpoint for long-running workflows\n  checkpoint(): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e\n  \n  // Get workflow instance ID\n  readonly workflowId: string\n  \n  // Access to durability metadata\n  readonly durability: {\n    lastCheckpoint: Date | null\n    actionCount: number\n    eventCount: number\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Layer 3: Durability Storage Schema\n\n**WorkflowInstances Table**\n```typescript\ninterface WorkflowInstanceRow {\n  id: string\n  name: string\n  status: 'active' | 'paused' | 'completed' | 'failed'\n  currentState?: string  // For state machines\n  context: Record\u003cstring, unknown\u003e\n  definition: WorkflowDefinition\n  createdAt: Date\n  updatedAt: Date\n  completedAt?: Date\n}\n```\n\n**WorkflowEvents Table**\n```typescript\ninterface WorkflowEventRow {\n  id: string\n  workflowId: string\n  sequence: number  // Monotonic for replay ordering\n  type: 'event' | 'schedule' | 'transition' | 'action' | 'checkpoint'\n  name: string\n  data: unknown\n  timestamp: Date\n}\n```\n\n**WorkflowSchedules Table**\n```typescript\ninterface WorkflowScheduleRow {\n  id: string\n  workflowId: string\n  interval: ScheduleInterval\n  handlerSource: string\n  nextExecution: Date\n  lastExecution?: Date\n  enabled: boolean\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Core Durability (Week 1-2)\n1. Implement `DurableWorkflowProvider` interface\n2. Add `MemoryDurableProvider` for testing\n3. Modify `Workflow()` to accept provider option\n4. Implement basic state persistence\n\n### Phase 2: Event Sourcing (Week 3-4)\n1. Implement event recording in `$.send()`, `$.do()`, `$.try()`\n2. Add `replayEvents()` for workflow recovery\n3. Implement checkpoint mechanism\n4. Add idempotency key support\n\n### Phase 3: Schedule Persistence (Week 5-6)\n1. Persist schedule registrations\n2. Implement schedule recovery on restart\n3. Add distributed lock for schedule execution\n4. Support schedule modification at runtime\n\n### Phase 4: Production Providers (Week 7-8)\n1. Implement `ClickHouseDurableWorkflowProvider`\n2. Add PostgreSQL/SQLite providers\n3. Implement batch write optimization\n4. Add migration tooling\n\n---\n\n## API Changes\n\n### New Workflow Options\n```typescript\nconst workflow = Workflow($ =\u003e { ... }, {\n  // New durability options\n  durable: true,  // Enable durability\n  provider: clickhouseProvider,  // Durability provider\n  workflowId: 'order-processing',  // Workflow instance ID\n  checkpointInterval: 1000,  // Auto-checkpoint every N events\n})\n```\n\n### Enhanced Context Methods\n```typescript\n// $.do now returns DurablePromise\nconst result = await $.do('Order.process', orderData)\nconsole.log(result.actionId)  // Access action ID\n\n// Manual checkpoint\nawait $.checkpoint()\n\n// Access durability info\nconsole.log($.durability.lastCheckpoint)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Integration with Existing Systems\n\n### DurablePromise Integration\n- `$.do()` will internally use `DurablePromise`\n- Actions created will reference workflow ID\n- Status updates flow through existing Action lifecycle\n\n### MemoryProvider Compatibility\n- `DatabaseContext` methods map to MemoryProvider\n- Event recording uses `emit()` pattern\n- Actions use existing `createAction()/updateAction()`\n\n### digital-workers Integration\n- Worker actions (notify, ask, approve) become durable\n- Escalation chains persist across restarts\n- Human approvals survive worker restarts\n\n---\n\n## Error Handling Strategy\n\n1. **Transient Failures**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff\n2. **Handler Failures**: Mark action as failed, emit error event\n3. **State Corruption**: Rebuild from event log\n4. **Provider Failures**: Graceful degradation to in-memory with queued writes\n\n---\n\n## Migration Strategy\n\n### Existing Workflows\n```typescript\n// Before (in-memory only)\nconst workflow = Workflow($ =\u003e { ... })\n\n// After (durable)\nconst workflow = Workflow($ =\u003e { ... }, {\n  durable: true,\n  provider: durableProvider,\n})\n```\n\n### Zero-Breaking-Change Path\n- `durable: false` (default) maintains current behavior\n- Opt-in durability per workflow\n- Gradual migration supported\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n1. **Unit Tests**: Mock provider, verify state changes\n2. **Integration Tests**: Full provider stack\n3. **Crash Recovery Tests**: Simulate process death and recovery\n4. **Performance Benchmarks**: Measure overhead vs in-memory\n\n---\n\n## Related Issues\n- Depends on: primitives.org.ai-6e7 (type safety), primitives.org.ai-cn5 (history limits), primitives.org.ai-iev (typed proxies) - ALL CLOSED\n- Blocks: v1.0 release\n\n## Conclusion\nThis design leverages the existing DurablePromise and Action patterns from ai-database while extending ai-workflows with persistence capabilities. The layered architecture allows for multiple storage backends and maintains backward compatibility with existing in-memory workflows.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-12T04:12:57.549998-06:00","created_by":"nathanclevenger","updated_at":"2026-01-14T04:58:30.526604-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-12T05:11:14.132621-06:00","close_reason":"Design documented, implementation plan created.

Code duplication (~1100 lines in ai-core + ~1140 lines in ai-functions + ~1779 lines in ai-database)\n2. Circular dependency potential (ai-database -\u003e ai-functions -\u003e ai-core)\n3.

This enables real embedding-based semantic search for entity matching.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### What Was Already Working (Verified)\nThe existing `resolveForwardFuzzy()` function in `/packages/ai-database/src/schema/semantic.ts` was already correctly integrated with the EmbeddingProvider:\n- Uses `provider.semanticSearch()` which internally uses the configured EmbeddingProvider\n- Properly extracts `${fieldName}Hint` for search queries\n- Falls back to field prompt when no hint is provided\n- Respects threshold configuration (`$fuzzyThreshold` or default 0.75)\n- Sets `$matched`, `$score`, `$matchedType` metadata on parent when matching\n- Sets `$generated`, `$generatedBy`, `$sourceField` flags on generated entities\n- Falls back to `generateEntity()` when no match is found\n\n### Test Coverage Added\nCreated `/packages/ai-database/test/forward-fuzzy-integration.test.ts` with 12 comprehensive tests:\n\n1. **Semantic Search Integration** (2 tests)\n   - Finding existing entity via semantic similarity\n   - Using embedTexts to embed the hint query\n\n2. **Fallback to Generation** (2 tests)\n   - Generate when findSimilar returns no results\n   - Generate when similarity is below threshold\n\n3. **Metadata Handling** (2 tests)\n   - Set $score metadata on parent when entity is matched\n   - Set $generated flag when entity is generated\n\n4. **Hint Field Extraction** (2 tests)\n   - Use ${fieldName}Hint as search query\n   - Fallback to field prompt when no hint provided\n\n5. **Threshold Configuration** (2 tests)\n   - Respect default threshold (0.75)\n   - Use entity-level $fuzzyThreshold\n\n6. **Array and Union Support** (2 tests)\n   - Find multiple matches for array ~\u003e fields\n   - Search across union types\n\n## Acceptance Criteria Status\n- [x] Semantic search uses real embeddings via EmbeddingProvider\n- [x] ${fieldName}Hint provides matching context\n- [x] Matches above threshold are reused\n- [x] No match triggers AI generation (via generateObject)\n- [x] $generated flag set on new entities\n- [x] $score metadata on matched entities\n\n## Test Results\n- All 12 new tests pass\n- All 15 existing forward-fuzzy.test.ts tests pass\n- No regressions introduced","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"aip-snyp","depends_on_id":"aip-sptt","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T04:07:02.792299-06:00","created_by":"Nathan Clevenger"},{"issue_id":"aip-snyp","depends_on_id":"aip-ayng","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T04:07:03.46652-06:00","created_by":"Nathan Clevenger"},{"issue_id":"aip-snyp","depends_on_id":"aip-6jwc","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-14T04:07:26.869146-06:00","created_by":"Nathan Clevenger"}]}

{"id":"aip-tor","title":"FEATURE: Define and implement error handling strategy","description":"No retry/backoff, no dead letter queues. This is a v1.0 blocker - production workflows need robust error handling.","notes":"# ai-workflows v1.0 Error Handling Strategy\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis document defines the error handling strategy for ai-workflows v1.0, building on the comprehensive error pattern analysis completed in dc0. The strategy establishes a unified approach that integrates with existing primitives.org.ai packages while providing production-ready error handling for workflow execution.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Current State Analysis\n\n### 1.1 Existing Error Classes in ai-workflows\n\nThe package currently defines 8 error classes across 4 modules:\n\n| Error Class | Module | Purpose | Properties |\n|------------|--------|---------|------------|\n| `CircularDependencyError` | dependency-graph.ts | Cycle detection | `cyclePath: string[]` |\n| `MissingDependencyError` | dependency-graph.ts | Missing dep reference | `dependency`, `node` |\n| `CascadeTimeoutError` | cascade-executor.ts | Cascade timeout | `timeout`, `elapsed` |\n| `TierSkippedError` | cascade-executor.ts | Tier skip tracking | `tier`, `reason` |\n| `AllTiersFailedError` | cascade-executor.ts | Complete failure | `history: TierResult[]` |\n| `CycleDetectedError` | topological-sort.ts | Graph cycles | `cyclePath: string[]` |\n| `MissingNodeError` | topological-sort.ts | Missing node ref | `missingNode`, `referencedBy` |\n| `BarrierTimeoutError` | barrier.ts | Barrier timeout | `timeout`, `arrived`, `expected` |\n\n### 1.2 Existing Retry Support\n\nCascadeExecutor already has basic retry support:\n- `TierRetryConfig` interface with `maxRetries`, `baseDelay`, `multiplier`\n- Per-tier retry configuration via `retryConfig` option\n- Exponential backoff implementation\n\n### 1.3 Key Gaps Identified\n\n1. **No Dead Letter Queue**: Failed events have no recovery mechanism\n2. **No Error Classification**: No systematic way to determine retry eligibility\n3. **No Unified Error Base Class**: Each error extends Error directly\n4. **Inconsistent with ai-functions**: Different error patterns than ai-functions' `RetryableError`/`NonRetryableError`\n5. **Missing Circuit Breaker**: No protection against cascading failures\n6. **No Error Escalation Integration**: CascadeExecutor doesn't integrate with digital-workers error-escalation\n\n---\n\n## 2. Error Handling Strategy\n\n### 2.1 Design Principles\n\n1. **Reuse Over Reinvent**: Leverage existing primitives from ai-functions and digital-workers\n2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Add error handling without breaking existing APIs\n3. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep error classification, retry, and escalation modular\n4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with discriminated unions\n5. **Observability**: Rich error metadata for debugging and monitoring\n\n### 2.2 Error Classification Model\n\nAdopt a **two-dimensional classification** combining ai-functions and digital-workers patterns:\n\n```typescript\n// Unified ErrorCategory (aligns with digital-workers)\nexport type WorkflowErrorCategory = 'transient' | 'permanent' | 'escalatable'\n\n// Mapping from ai-functions categories\nconst CATEGORY_MAPPING: Record\u003cai_functions.ErrorCategory, WorkflowErrorCategory\u003e = {\n  network: 'transient',      // Retryable\n  rate_limit: 'transient',   // Retryable with backoff\n  server: 'transient',       // Retryable\n  invalid_input: 'permanent', // Not retryable\n  authentication: 'permanent', // Not retryable\n  context_length: 'permanent', // Not retryable without modification\n  unknown: 'transient',      // Default to transient (optimistic)\n}\n```\n\n### 2.3 Error Base Class\n\nIntroduce `WorkflowError` base class that bridges both patterns:\n\n```typescript\nexport abstract class WorkflowError extends Error {\n  readonly code: string\n  readonly timestamp: Date = new Date()\n  readonly correlationId?: string\n  \n  abstract readonly category: WorkflowErrorCategory\n  abstract readonly retryable: boolean\n  \n  // Preserve ai-functions compatibility\n  toClassifiedError(): ai_functions.ErrorCategory {\n    return reverseClassify(this.category)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2.4 Existing Error Migration\n\nMigrate existing errors to extend WorkflowError:\n\n```typescript\n// Before\nexport class CascadeTimeoutError extends Error {\n  public readonly timeout: number\n  public readonly elapsed: number\n}\n\n// After\nexport class CascadeTimeoutError extends WorkflowError {\n  readonly code = 'CASCADE_TIMEOUT'\n  readonly category: WorkflowErrorCategory = 'transient'\n  readonly retryable = true\n  \n  constructor(\n    public readonly timeout: number,\n    public readonly elapsed: number,\n    correlationId?: string\n  ) {\n    super(`Cascade timed out after ${elapsed}ms (limit: ${timeout}ms)`)\n    this.correlationId = correlationId\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Retry Strategy\n\n### 3.1 RetryPolicy Integration\n\nWrap ai-functions' `RetryPolicy` for workflow-specific use:\n\n```typescript\nimport { RetryPolicy, calculateBackoff } from 'ai-functions'\n\nexport interface WorkflowRetryConfig {\n  maxRetries?: number           // Default: 3\n  baseDelay?: number            // Default: 1000ms\n  maxDelay?: number             // Default: 30000ms\n  multiplier?: number           // Default: 2\n  jitter?: number               // Default: 0.1 (10%)\n  jitterStrategy?: JitterStrategy // Default: 'decorrelated'\n  respectRetryAfter?: boolean   // Default: true\n}\n\nexport function createWorkflowRetryPolicy(config?: WorkflowRetryConfig): RetryPolicy {\n  return new RetryPolicy({\n    maxRetries: config?.maxRetries ?? 3,\n    baseDelay: config?.baseDelay ?? 1000,\n    maxDelay: config?.maxDelay ?? 30000,\n    multiplier: config?.multiplier ?? 2,\n    jitter: config?.jitter ?? 0.1,\n    jitterStrategy: config?.jitterStrategy ?? 'decorrelated',\n    respectRetryAfter: config?.respectRetryAfter ?? true,\n    shouldRetry: (error) =\u003e {\n      if (error instanceof WorkflowError) {\n        return error.retryable\n      }\n      // Classify unknown errors using ai-functions heuristics\n      const category = ai_functions.classifyError(error)\n      return RETRYABLE_CATEGORIES.has(category)\n    },\n  })\n}\n```\n\n### 3.2 Per-Handler Retry Configuration\n\nAllow retry configuration at handler registration:\n\n```typescript\n$.on.Order.failed(\n  async (order, $) =\u003e {\n    await processRefund(order)\n  },\n  {\n    retry: {\n      maxRetries: 5,\n      baseDelay: 2000,\n      onRetry: (attempt, error) =\u003e {\n        $.log(`Retry ${attempt} after: ${error.message}`)\n      },\n    },\n  }\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)\n\n### 4.1 DLQ Interface\n\n```typescript\nexport interface DeadLetterEntry {\n  id: string\n  event: string\n  payload: unknown\n  error: WorkflowError\n  attempts: number\n  firstFailedAt: Date\n  lastFailedAt: Date\n  correlationId: string\n  metadata?: Record\u003cstring, unknown\u003e\n}\n\nexport interface DeadLetterQueue {\n  push(entry: Omit\u003cDeadLetterEntry, 'id'\u003e): Promise\u003cstring\u003e\n  peek(limit?: number): Promise\u003cDeadLetterEntry[]\u003e\n  retry(id: string): Promise\u003cboolean\u003e\n  remove(id: string): Promise\u003cboolean\u003e\n  purge(olderThan?: Date): Promise\u003cnumber\u003e\n  size(): Promise\u003cnumber\u003e\n}\n```\n\n### 4.2 In-Memory Implementation (v1.0)\n\n```typescript\nexport function createInMemoryDLQ(options?: {\n  maxSize?: number\n  ttlMs?: number\n}): DeadLetterQueue {\n  // Implementation with LRU eviction and TTL\n}\n```\n\n### 4.3 Integration with Event Bus\n\n```typescript\n// Enhanced send function\nexport async function send(\n  event: string,\n  payload: unknown,\n  options?: {\n    dlq?: DeadLetterQueue\n    retry?: WorkflowRetryConfig\n    timeout?: number\n  }\n): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n  const policy = createWorkflowRetryPolicy(options?.retry)\n  \n  try {\n    await policy.execute(async () =\u003e {\n      await eventBus.emit(event, payload)\n    })\n  } catch (error) {\n    if (options?.dlq) {\n      await options.dlq.push({\n        event,\n        payload,\n        error: toWorkflowError(error),\n        attempts: policy.attempts,\n        firstFailedAt: new Date(),\n        lastFailedAt: new Date(),\n        correlationId: getCurrentCorrelationId(),\n      })\n    }\n    throw error\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Circuit Breaker Integration\n\n### 5.1 Reuse ai-functions CircuitBreaker\n\n```typescript\nimport { CircuitBreaker, CircuitOpenError } from 'ai-functions'\n\nexport interface WorkflowCircuitConfig {\n  failureThreshold?: number    // Default: 5\n  resetTimeout?: number        // Default: 30000ms\n  successThreshold?: number    // Default: 1\n}\n\n// Per-handler circuit breaker\n$.on.ExternalAPI.request(\n  async (request, $) =\u003e {\n    return await externalApiCall(request)\n  },\n  {\n    circuitBreaker: {\n      failureThreshold: 3,\n      resetTimeout: 60000,\n    },\n  }\n)\n```\n\n### 5.2 Circuit State in WorkflowContext\n\n```typescript\ninterface WorkflowContext {\n  // Existing...\n  \n  // Circuit breaker state\n  circuits: Map\u003cstring, CircuitBreaker\u003e\n  getCircuit(name: string): CircuitBreaker\n  isCircuitOpen(name: string): boolean\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Error Escalation Integration\n\n### 6.1 Connect CascadeExecutor to digital-workers\n\n```typescript\nimport { \n  createEscalationEngine, \n  EscalationResult \n} from 'digital-workers'\n\nexport interface CascadeConfigWithEscalation extends CascadeConfig {\n  escalation?: {\n    enabled: boolean\n    policy?: EscalationPolicy\n    onEscalate?: (result: EscalationResult) =\u003e void\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 6.2 Enhanced CascadeExecutor\n\n```typescript\n// In CascadeExecutor.executeTier()\nif (escalationConfig?.enabled \u0026\u0026 tierResult.error) {\n  const escalationResult = await escalationEngine.handleError(\n    tierResult.error,\n    {\n      tier: tier,\n      agentId: context.cascadeContext.correlationId,\n      taskId: context.cascadeContext.name,\n      retryState: currentRetryState,\n      escalationHistory: history.map(h =\u003e h.tier),\n    }\n  )\n  \n  if (escalationResult.action === 'escalate') {\n    this.emitEvent({\n      who: this.actor,\n      what: `error-escalated`,\n      when: Date.now(),\n      where: this.cascadeName,\n      why: escalationResult.escalationPath?.reason,\n      how: {\n        status: 'escalated',\n        metadata: {\n          fromTier: tier,\n          toTier: escalationResult.escalationPath?.toTier,\n        },\n      },\n    })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7. Error Handling Hooks\n\n### 7.1 Global Error Handlers\n\n```typescript\n// In Workflow definition\nconst workflow = Workflow($ =\u003e {\n  // Register handlers...\n}, {\n  onError: async (error, context) =\u003e {\n    // Global error handling\n    await alerting.notify(error)\n  },\n  onRetry: (attempt, error, context) =\u003e {\n    metrics.increment('workflow.retry', { attempt })\n  },\n  onDLQ: (entry) =\u003e {\n    logger.warn('Event sent to DLQ', entry)\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### 7.2 Per-Event Error Handlers\n\n```typescript\n$.on.Payment.process(\n  async (payment, $) =\u003e {\n    await processPayment(payment)\n  },\n  {\n    onError: async (error, payment, $) =\u003e {\n      // Event-specific error handling\n      await notifyPaymentTeam(payment, error)\n    },\n  }\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 8. Implementation Priorities\n\n### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)\n1. **WorkflowError Base Class**: Create base class and migrate existing errors\n2. **Error Classification**: Implement classifyWorkflowError() function\n3. **Enhanced Retry**: Integrate ai-functions RetryPolicy with workflow handlers\n\n### Phase 2: DLQ \u0026 Circuit Breaker (Week 3-4)\n4. **In-Memory DLQ**: Implement DeadLetterQueue interface\n5. **Circuit Breaker Integration**: Add circuit breaker support to handlers\n6. **Error Hooks**: Implement onError, onRetry, onDLQ hooks\n\n### Phase 3: Escalation Integration (Week 5-6)\n7. **CascadeExecutor Enhancement**: Connect to digital-workers escalation\n8. **Unified Error Flow**: End-to-end error handling with all components\n9. **Documentation \u0026 Examples**: Comprehensive docs with examples\n\n### Phase 4: Testing \u0026 Validation (Week 7-8)\n10. **Error Scenario Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage\n11. **Integration Tests**: Cross-package integration testing\n12. **Performance Testing**: Ensure no significant overhead\n\n---\n\n## 9. Migration Guide\n\n### 9.1 Backward Compatibility\n\nAll existing error classes will continue to work. New features are opt-in:\n\n```typescript\n// Existing code continues to work\nconst executor = new CascadeExecutor({\n  tiers: { code: handler },\n})\n\n// New error handling is opt-in\nconst enhancedExecutor = new CascadeExecutor({\n  tiers: { code: handler },\n  retry: { maxRetries: 5 },\n  escalation: { enabled: true },\n  dlq: createInMemoryDLQ(),\n})\n```\n\n### 9.2 Deprecation Path\n\nNo immediate deprecations. Future consideration:\n- After ai-errors package is created, errors will be re-exported from there\n- Add deprecation warnings pointing to ai-errors imports\n\n---\n\n## 10. Success Criteria\n\n1. **All existing tests pass** - No breaking changes\n2. **Error classification accuracy \u003e95%** - Correct retry/escalate decisions\n3. **DLQ prevents data loss** - Failed events recoverable\n4. **Circuit breaker prevents cascade failures** - System stability under load\n5. **Full observability** - Errors traceable end-to-end via correlationId\n6. **Documentation complete** - Examples for all error handling patterns\n\n---\n\n## Appendix A: Error Code Registry\n\n| Code | Error Class | Category | Retryable |\n|------|------------|----------|-----------|\n| `CIRCULAR_DEPENDENCY` | CircularDependencyError | permanent | false |\n| `MISSING_DEPENDENCY` | MissingDependencyError | permanent | false |\n| `CASCADE_TIMEOUT` | CascadeTimeoutError | transient | true |\n| `TIER_SKIPPED` | TierSkippedError | permanent | false |\n| `ALL_TIERS_FAILED` | AllTiersFailedError | escalatable | false |\n| `CYCLE_DETECTED` | CycleDetectedError | permanent | false |\n| `MISSING_NODE` | MissingNodeError | permanent | false |\n| `BARRIER_TIMEOUT` | BarrierTimeoutError | transient | true |\n\n## Appendix B: Related Issues\n\n- dc0: ARCH: Unify error handling patterns across packages (completed)\n- Future: Create ai-errors package with unified base classes","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-12T04:12:57.859476-06:00","created_by":"nathanclevenger","updated_at":"2026-01-14T04:58:30.526046-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-12T05:11:25.440921-06:00","close_reason":"Strategy defined with comprehensive 8-week implementation plan.

The implementation:\n\n1. **Uses real embeddings** via the `EmbeddingProvider` interface:\n   - Custom embedding providers can be injected via `createMemoryProvider({ embeddingProvider: ... })`\n   - Falls back to mock embeddings for testing\n   - Supports `embedTexts()`, `findSimilar()`, and `cosineSimilarity()` methods\n\n2. **Semantic Search Flow**:\n   - Extracts hint from `${fieldName}Hint` input field\n   - Uses `searchUnionTypes()` for union type fallback search\n   - Respects threshold configuration (entity-level `$fuzzyThreshold` or default 0.75)\n   - Returns null when no match found (never generates)\n\n3. **Metadata on Matches**:\n   - `${field}$score` - similarity score of the match\n   - `${field}$matchedType` - which union type matched\n   - `${field}$fallbackUsed` - whether fallback to later union types was needed\n   - `${field}$searchOrder` - order in which types were searched\n\n#### Test Coverage\n\nCreated comprehensive integration test file: `test/backward-fuzzy-integration.test.ts` with 13 tests covering:\n\n- Core grounding behavior (semantic search, null on no match, $score metadata)\n- Union type fallback search (priority order, $matchedType)\n- Threshold configuration (entity-level thresholds)\n- Difference from ~\u003e (never generates new entities)\n- Edge cases (missing hints, arrays, pre-provided values)\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria Status\n- [x] Grounds against reference data via real embeddings\n- [x] Returns null when no match (does NOT generate)\n- [x] Union type fallback searches collections in order\n- [x] $matchedType indicates which collection matched\n- [x] Threshold configuration respected\n- [x] $score metadata on matches\n\nAll tests pass: 13/13","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"aip-um98","depends_on_id":"aip-sptt","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T04:07:04.200538-06:00","created_by":"Nathan Clevenger"},{"issue_id":"aip-um98","depends_on_id":"aip-6jwc","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-14T04:07:28.083864-06:00","created_by":"Nathan Clevenger"}]}
