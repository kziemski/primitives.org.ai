Just say what you need.

```typescript
import { ai, list, is } from 'ai-functions'

const qualified = is`${lead} a good fit for enterprise?`
const ideas = list`content topics for ${persona}`
const { summary, nextSteps } = ai`analyze ${salesCall}`
```

## Promise Pipelining

Chain operations without `await`:

```typescript
// Destructure for exactly what you need
const { score, qualified, reason } = ai`qualify ${lead}`

// Chain naturally—dependencies resolve automatically
const email = ai`follow-up email based on: ${reason}`
const subject = ai`subject line for: ${email}`

// Only await when you need the value
if (await qualified) {
  await send({ subject: await subject, body: await email })
}
```

## Batch with `.map()`

Process arrays in a single call:

```typescript
const leads = list`leads from ${campaign}`

const qualified = await leads.map(lead => ({
  lead,
  score: ai`score 1-100: ${lead}`,
  fit: is`${lead} matches ${icp}?`,
}))
```
