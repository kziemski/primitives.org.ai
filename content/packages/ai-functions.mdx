```bash
npm install ai-functions
```

Say what you need. Get what you asked for.

```typescript
import { ai, list, is } from 'ai-functions'

// Ask questions
const qualified = is`${lead} a good fit for enterprise?`

// Generate lists
const ideas = list`content topics for ${persona}`

// Get structured data through destructuring
const { summary, nextSteps } = ai`analyze ${salesCall}`
```

## Promise Pipelining

Chain without `await`:

```typescript
const { score, reason } = ai`qualify ${lead}`
const email = ai`follow-up based on: ${reason}`

if (await score > 80) {
  await send(await email)
}
```

## Batch Processing

Process arrays in one call:

```typescript
const qualified = await list`leads`.map(lead => ({
  lead,
  fit: is`${lead} matches ${icp}?`,
  action: ai`next step for ${lead}`,
}))
```
