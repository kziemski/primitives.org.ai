npm install services-as-software
```

Primitives for building AI-powered services that cross business boundaries with pricing, SLAs, and autonomous delivery.

```typescript
import { Service, POST, Client } from 'services-as-software'

const translationService = Service({
  name: 'translation-service',
  version: '1.0.0',
  pricing: {
    model: 'per-use',
    pricePerUnit: 0.01,
    currency: 'USD',
  },
  endpoints: [
    POST({
      name: 'translate',
      path: '/translate',
      handler: async (input) => ({
        translatedText: `Translated: ${input.text}`,
        confidence: 0.95,
      }),
    }),
  ],
})

// Use the service
const result = await translationService.call('translate', {
  text: 'Hello, world!',
  to: 'es',
})
```

## Core Primitives

- **`Service()`** — Define services with endpoints, pricing, and business logic
- **`Client()`** — Connect to remote services
- **`Provider()`** — Manage multiple services
- **`POST()`, `GET()`, `PUT()`, `DELETE()`** — HTTP method helpers

## Service Operations

- **`ask()`**, **`do()`**, **`generate()`** — Execute tasks
- **`quote()`**, **`order()`**, **`subscribe()`** — Commerce operations
- **`on()`**, **`every()`** — Events and scheduling
- **`kpis()`**, **`okrs()`**, **`entitlements()`** — Business metrics

## Entity Definitions (Nouns)

Comprehensive entities for AI-delivered productized services:

| Category | Entities |
|----------|----------|
| **Services** | ProductizedService, ServiceOffering, ServicePlan, ServiceInstance, ServiceExecution |
| **Delivery** | AgentDelivery, AutonomyLevel, EscalationRule, ConfidenceThreshold, HumanHandoff, QualityGate |
| **Billing** | ServiceQuote, ServiceOrder, ServiceSubscription, Usage, Invoice, Payment |
| **Operations** | SLA, SLO, ServiceIncident, SupportTicket, ServiceFeedback, ServiceMetric |
| **Customers** | ServiceCustomer, ServiceEntitlement, CustomerUsage, CustomerSegment |
| **Orchestration** | ServiceWorkflow, WorkflowStep, ServiceTask, ServiceQueue, ServiceWorker |

```typescript
import { AgentDelivery, ProductizedService } from 'services-as-software'

console.log(AgentDelivery.properties.autonomyLevel)
// { type: 'string', examples: ['full', 'supervised', 'assisted', 'advisory'] }
```
